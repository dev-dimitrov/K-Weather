K-Weather is a very simple GUI application to check the weather worldwide, this is my second project with the JavaFX library and I hope you like it; with this project too I learned to work with API responses using Jackson lib. 

**All the information was provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) free API.**

## 🌟Features🌟
- Real and _feels like_ temperature shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit, you can change the units by clicking on the temp.
- A brief description of the weather, for example: `Clear sky, Overcast clouds, Moderate rain...`.
- Dynamic icons and backgrounds for every weather status. (Icons by OpenWeather and backgrounds by me).
- Percentage of the humidity.
