# ⛅K-Weather⛅
![1-github](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1db1eea5-3999-48e5-b797-be2d8cf09c5c)

K-Weather is a very simple GUI application to check the weather worldwide, this is my second project with the JavaFX library and I hope you like it; with this project too I learned to work with API responses using Jackson lib. 

**All the information was provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) free API.**

**Humidity icon by [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)**

## 🌟Features🌟
- Real and _feels like_ temperature shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit, you can change the units by clicking on the temp.
- A brief description of the weather, for example: `Clear sky, Overcast clouds, Moderate rain...`.
- Dynamic icons and backgrounds for every weather status. (Icons by OpenWeather and backgrounds by me).
- Percentage of the humidity.

You can search only by city name or by city and country (You must type a comma between the city and the country). It's also possible to type a country code ([ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2#Current_codes)).
