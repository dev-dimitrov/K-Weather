K-Weather is a simple GUI application to check the weather worldwide, this is my second project with the JavaFX library and I hope you like it.
With this project I learned too to work with API responses with Jackson lib.

## Features
- Temperature shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- Percentage of humidity
- A brief description of the weather, for ex: "Clear sky".
